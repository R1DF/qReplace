# qReplace
Have you gotten tired of copy-pasting specific symbols or ALT codes to enter certain characters when you'd just want to
create an [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script to replace text patterns, but you don't know how AutoHotKey works? qReplace will help you
do just that.<br>

qReplace is a simple GUI tool that gives you the ability to enter any pattern you wish to replace with another symbol
or sting of text. By creating a prefix and an optional suffix for your patterns, you can create organised files that
will replace the text you want to be replaced with what you want.<br>

# Installation
qReplace is only available for Windows devices. Downloads are in the Releases section of this repository.<br>
The current version is v1.0.0.<br>

You may also run the program through its source code with Python 3 installed. The oldest version which can run this
program is Python 3.10 as a result of match-case statements being used. This way, Mac OS and Linux users are also
able to download and try out the program.<br>

# Problems and suggestions
To submit any problems or suggestions, the Issues branch of the repository can be used for those purposes.
